Penguin Button - PenStat

2 things that are similar: we both need to add the icon, buttons both have imported aspects 
2 things that are different: different hover implementation, our color variation is on the button and theirs is a seperate button

Code snippet you plan on using: disable snippet 
Return css
:host([disabled]) {
        filter: grayscale(80%);
        pointer-events: none;
      }
Static get properties ()
disabled: { type: Boolean, reflect: true },
constructor() {
this.disabled = false;
